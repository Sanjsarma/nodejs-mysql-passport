# nodejs-mysql-passport

This is an authentication app using Node.js, Express.js and the authentication middleware Passport.js, with MySQL database.
The main advantage of using Passport.js is that users can view pages only after logging in successfully.

I found very less documentation for linking Passport.js with MySQL database, so I hope this helps.
The npm packages used are: <br>
express <br>
express-ejs-layouts(you can use handlebars or pug) <br>
mysql <br>
bcrypt(For hashing password) <br>
flash(For flash messages) <br>
express-session <br>
passport-local <br>
passport(For authentication during login) <br>
